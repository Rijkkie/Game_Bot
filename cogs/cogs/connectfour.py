# Connect Four v2.1
# - Last Updated: 02 Jun 2021
#===============================================================================
# Update History
# ..............................................................................
# 02 Jun 2021 - Added support for inactivity timer of sessions. -YJ
# 30 May 2021 - Reaction join now goes through cog's join() instead of Game's
#               join(), which allows for better specialization; Added database
#               support. -YJ
# 24 May 2021 - Renamed fourOnARow.py to connectfour.py and class fourOnARow to
#               ConnectFour to match Python naming convention; Rewrote file a
#               considerable amount to match common functions/classes; Removed
#               some unnecessary functions. -YJ
# 24 Apr 2021 - Added color and name of player that can make a move - RK
# 24 Apr 2021 - Fixed bug where when one column was filled only one player could
#               play - RK
# 22 Apr 2021 - Game works for most cases -RK
# 21 Apr 2021 - Copied parts of tictactoe.py and started to think about
#               what needed to be different -RK
#===============================================================================
# Notes
# ..............................................................................
# - Make the game able to have different board sizes, different color styles-
#  (its now made for darkmode) -RK
#===============================================================================
# Description
# ..............................................................................
# connectfour.py plays a game where two players take turns placing their token
# into the bottom row of a column in a 6x7 grid. When four tokens belonging to
# the same player line up, that player wins.
